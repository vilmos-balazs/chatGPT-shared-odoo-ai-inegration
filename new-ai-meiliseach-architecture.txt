📋 COMPLETE CONTEXT RECAP: Agentic AI Integration with MeiliSearch Enhancement
🏗️ Current Architecture (Odoo 16 CE)
Module: agentic_ai_integration_with_livechat
✅ Implemented & Working:

🤖 Multi-Provider AI: Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini with factory pattern
🛠️ Tool Registry: Python-defined tools with persistent database metadata
📝 Prompt Templates: Database-editable prompts with Python fallbacks
⚡ Function Calling Engine: Parses AI responses, orchestrates tool execution
🌍 Multilingual Support: Romanian, Hungarian, English via native Odoo translation
🔒 Channel Security: Livechat (business-only) vs Internal (unrestricted)
🔄 Smart Sync: Load new tools/prompts, sync all with confirmation wizards

📊 Database-Driven Configuration:

Providers: max_tokens, temperature, endpoint_url - all editable via forms
Tools: keywords, ai_usage_context, priority - customizable without code
Prompts: Template content fully editable - changes effective immediately


🚨 Core Issues Identified:
1. Product Search Quality (30% success rate)

❌ Basic SQL ILIKE: Poor relevance, no ranking
❌ No typo tolerance: "zowohom" → 0 results
❌ Wrong category table: Uses product.template.categ_id instead of product.public.category (website categories)
❌ No multilingual intelligence: Romanian query → English-only results
❌ No semantic understanding: "lac parchet" doesn't find parquet finishes

2. Token Limit Bug (FIXED)

Issue: Function calling hardcoded to 200 tokens despite provider setting 1000+
Fix: Now uses self.provider_record.max_tokens (database-driven)
Hardware: RTX 4070 Ti + Qwen2.5:7b (32K context) → Can handle 2,500+ tokens safely


🎯 Proposed Solution: MeiliSearch Integration
🔧 Architecture Enhancement:
User Query → AI Agent (language detection + intent) → Enhanced Search Tools → MeiliSearch (fast, intelligent search) → Ranked product_ids → Odoo (full records) → AI Agent (natural response formatting) → User
🏆 Why MeiliSearch:

✅ Multilingual analyzers: Romanian, Hungarian, English built-in
✅ Typo tolerance: Advanced fuzzy matching
✅ Fast setup: Docker container alongside Odoo
✅ E-commerce ready: Facets, filters, ranking rules
✅ Self-hosted: Full control, no vendor lock-in
✅ Tool-pattern friendly: Perfect fit for existing architecture


🛠️ Implementation Plan:
1. MeiliSearch Setup:

Docker container with proper configuration
Index settings: Multilingual searchable fields, synonyms, ranking rules
Synonym mapping: "lac" = "vopsea" = "paint" = "festék"

2. New Tools in Registry:
pythonmeilisearch_sync_tool           # Odoo JSONB → MeiliSearch flattened format
meilisearch_product_search_tool # Replaces current ProductSearchTool  
meilisearch_category_search_tool # Uses product.public.category
meilisearch_queue_processor     # Real-time sync triggers
3. Data Transformation:
Odoo JSONB: {"en_US": "Paint", "ro_RO": "Lac", "hu_HU": "Festék"}
MeiliSearch: {"name_en": "Paint", "name_ro": "Lac", "name_hu": "Festék"}
4. Enhanced Search Logic:

Multi-stage: Category detection → Exact phrase → Multi-keyword → Fuzzy → Description
Intelligent ranking: Exact match + category relevance + brand recognition + availability
Context-aware: "lac parchet" → Prioritize parquet-specific products


📈 Expected Quality Improvements:
Search Quality: 30% → 85%+

✅ Typo tolerance: "zowohom" → finds "ZowoHome"
✅ Semantic matching: "lac parchet" → parquet finishes
✅ Proper categories: Website categories (product.public.category)
✅ Multilingual intelligence: Romanian queries → Romanian results

Response Quality: 40% → 90%+

✅ Relevant results: MeiliSearch ranked results
✅ Natural flow: AI still handles conversation
✅ Performance: 10x faster (5-15ms vs 200-500ms)

Concrete Example:
Query: "aveti lac zowohome mat pentru parchet?"
Current: Confusing, irrelevant products
New: "Am găsit 3 lacuri ZowoHome mate pentru parchet: 1) ZowoHome 8400 Mat Parchet - 45 RON/L, în stoc..."

🎯 Key Architectural Principles Maintained:

✅ Database-driven: All configuration via forms, no code changes needed
✅ Tool-based: MeiliSearch integrated as enhanced tools in existing registry
✅ AI-orchestrated: AI remains central intelligence layer
✅ Provider-agnostic: Works with any AI provider (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
✅ Multilingual-native: Leverages Odoo's translation system + MeiliSearch analyzers


🚀 Next Steps:

Implement MeiliSearch sync tools with JSONB flattening
Replace ProductSearchTool with enhanced MeiliSearch version
Add category search using product.public.category
Configure real-time sync triggers
Test with increased token limits (2,500+ tokens)

Expected Outcome: 200-300% improvement in search quality and response intelligence while maintaining the elegant, database-driven, AI-orchestrated architecture.

the modul name we are workg on is : agentic_ai_integration_with_livechat

Do not generate any code just wait to load all source files, and analyze it at the end. I let you know when all are loade! wait!!

wens you generate code i am expecting alway to a cat > agentic_ai_integration_with_livechat/file_name << EOF...EOF  paste ready commands with complete file content. Do such commands for each file you chaned!

as regards tools, I want you to keep existing solution, as a backup. develop new tools for new solution and will see at the end, when we compare the curent and future solution, if we cancel curent tools or keep it as backup.

✅ Smart Strategy: Parallel Tool Development
🔄 Backup + New Architecture:
Keep Existing (Backup):

ProductSearchTool → Stays as fallback
ProductCategoryTool → Backup solution
StockCheckTool → Keep unchanged
CompanyInfoTool → Keep unchanged

Create New (MeiliSearch):

MeiliProductSearchTool → Enhanced version
MeiliProductCategoryTool → Public categories + intelligence
MeiliSyncTool → Data synchronization
MeiliConfigTool → Settings management


🎯 Implementation Strategy:
Phase 1: Foundation

MeiliSearch setup (Docker + config)
MeiliSyncTool - Get data flowing
Basic MeiliProductSearchTool - Test search quality

Phase 2: Enhancement

MeiliProductCategoryTool - Public categories
AI prompt optimization for new tools
Real-time sync triggers

Phase 3: Comparison

A/B testing old vs new tools
Performance benchmarking
Decide: Replace or keep both
