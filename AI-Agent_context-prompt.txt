📝 Odoo 16 Agentic AI Livechat Project – MASTER CONTEXT & CONTINUATION PROMPT (Ultra-Abstracted)
1. Solution Overview and Goals
Design a fully agentic, multi-provider, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enabled, tool-using AI livechat assistant for Odoo 16 Community Edition.
This system must support:

Dynamic orchestration and chaining of backend data “tools” (e.g., product queries, datasheets, stock, logistics, etc.) by the AI agent.

Pluggable support for any local or remote AI model (Ollama, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) via a provider abstraction.

Livechat integration for website visitors (business-topic–restricted) and Discuss channel for internal staff (unrestricted).

Operator “takeover” at any point, pausing AI and restoring manual handling.

Automatic detection and handling of user language in all communications.

Extensible, maintainable, and minimal core—no lock-in to third-party module architectures or dependencies.

2. Implementation Plan (Abstracted Steps)

Step 1: Environment Preparation

Ensure Odoo 16 Community Edition is running.

Prepare at least one AI model endpoint (local or remote).

Step 2: Module Foundation

Scaffold a clean, custom Odoo module for agentic livechat integration.

Keep codebase modular, abstract, and decoupled from vendor-specific logic.

Step 3: Agent and Provider Abstraction

Implement a flexible provider interface for all AI models/services.

Register Odoo data tools (business logic functions) for agentic use.

System prompt(s) should declare available tools and business rules.

Step 4: Orchestration and Data Grounding

AI agent dynamically chains calls to tools as needed, always grounding answers in live Odoo data (RAG).

Step 5: Business/Channel Rules

Restrict web livechat to business topics; handle off-topic queries gracefully.

Internal Discuss channel: full agent/tool access.

Enable operator override/handover for any chat session.

Step 6: Multilingual Support

Detect/respond in user’s language throughout.

Step 7: Testing and Documentation

Test all agent flows and document for extensibility.

3. File Output Format Requirement
For every code/config change, reply with full file contents using cat > ... <<EOF ... EOF shell commands.
No partial diffs or snippets—always full files, ready to copy-paste.

4. For Future Continuation

Always begin by pasting this context.

State the current or next step.

All design and code must preserve agent/provider abstraction, tool registry, and future extensibility.

No architecture lock-in, no vendor/module-specific code—abstraction and flexibility are top priorities.
