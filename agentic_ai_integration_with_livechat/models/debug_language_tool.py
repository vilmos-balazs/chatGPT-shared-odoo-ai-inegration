# DEBUG LANGUAGE TOOL REMOVED
# This tool was interfering with core language detection
# Language detection is now handled exclusively by the agentic agent
# with isolated AI calls to prevent contamination

# If you need to debug language detection, use the main test wizard
# with different language queries and check the server logs
