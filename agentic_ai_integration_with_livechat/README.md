# Agentic AI Integration with Livechat

## Abstract
Ultra-abstract, vendor-agnostic agentic AI assistant for Odoo 16 Community Edition, integrating with website Livechat and Discuss, supporting dynamic tool orchestration, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-provider models (Ollama, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), operator takeover, and full multilingual support.

## Key Principles
- Modular, minimal core with agent/provider abstraction.
- No vendor lock-in. All tool logic is decoupled.
- Business logic and AI model endpoints are pluggable.

## Next Steps
1. Implement provider/agent abstraction layer.
2. Register backend business tools for agentic access.
3. Implement agent orchestration and UI/channel logic.
4. Add language detection and operator override.
